This is a file repository for my (Simon Abrahamse's) APPM 4600 Numerical Methods class. Currently, only the files from Lab 1 are stored in there, however, as the class moves forward all of my files from homework and labs will be stored in this repository. 
The file structure is comprised of my 'Labs' and 'Homework' folders, which have subfolders in each of them for every lab or homework I will do in this class.
NOTE: This is my first time using both Python and Github and I'm super happy to be learning this. I love coding and wish I did more in the Mechanical Engineering department, so please bear with me while I learn how to do this. Thank you for all of the help so far Logan.
